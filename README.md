## Automated Detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Using Machine Learning Techniques
Small description about the project like one below
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem that affects the hormones of women during their reproductive years. It can cause irregular periods, excess hair growth, acne, infertility, and other health issues. 

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Polycystic  ovary  syndrome  (PCOS)  is  a  complex heterogeneous  endocrine  disorder  that  affects  the  femaleâ€™s reproductive system.  PCOS usually affects 12 to 21% of reproductive-age  women,  out  of  which  70%  remain undiagnosed. This  syndrome  often  causes  menstrual abnormalities,  hyperandrogenism,  fertility  problems,  and metabolic sequelae. It is characterized by features that include irregular  menstrual  cycles,  acne,  and  hirsutism. Despite  the  presence  of  diagnostic  criteria,  there  are various clinical uncertainties and complexities when it comes to the diagnosis of PCOS. 

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
Clinical Features:
- Demographic data: Age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI)
- Menstrual history: Cycle regularity, length of cycles, presence of absent or irregular periods
- Signs and symptoms: Excessive hair growth, acne, weight gain
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
Other potential features:
- Family history of PCOS
- Presence of co-morbidities like diabetes

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes Matlab, OpenCV, and Machine Learning.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In  this  paper,  we  have  investigated  the  use  of classification algorithms to  identify patients with Polycystic Ovary  Syndrome  (PCOS). We  studied  several  machine learning algorithms on a large dataset using cross-validation technique,  statistical  tests,  and  physician  opinion.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
